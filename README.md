Person Queue Management System is Micro-Project Based on Subject DSA , Semester 3 Diploma Computer Engineering

About Project :
The Person Queue Management System is an essential application for managing lists of people in various real-world scenarios, such as customer service centers, hospitals, or ticketing systems, where it is crucial to handle people on a first-come, first-served basis. This project ensures that individuals are processed efficiently by maintaining a queue where users can add, remove, and search for persons. The First In, First Out (FIFO) principle helps manage the flow of people, ensuring fairness and transparency in the order of service.

This system provides a user-friendly interface, making it easy to manage and view the queue. Such a tool can be highly valuable in environments where timely processing is crucial, helping organizations improve their operational efficiency and customer satisfaction. Additionally, this project helps students understand key data structures concepts like queues, which are fundamental in computer science and programming.

Aim of the Micro Project :
To develop a program in C that maintains a queue of persons, allowing users to add, remove, and search for persons in the queue, 
effectively demonstrating the real-world application of the queue data structure.
